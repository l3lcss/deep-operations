# deep-operations

A javascritp library to work with deep object modifications.

## Why deep-operations?

Sometimes doing deep objects modifications is quite difficult
and not so performatic. Deep Operations gives a collection
of modular functions to work with operations like:

* Deep objects merge
* Deep arrays concatenation
* Deep objects differentiation
* And many others

A simple doc can be found [here](https://gsseixas.github.io/deep-operations/).
