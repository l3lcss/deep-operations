# deep-operations

A javascritp library to work with deep object modifications.

## Motivation

Sometimes doing deep objects modifications would be difficult
and not so performatic.
Deep Operations gives a collection of modular functions to work
with operations like:

* Deep objects merge
* Deep arrays concatenation
* Deep objects differentiation
* And many others

A simple doc with the functions can be found [here](https://gsseixas.github.io/deep-operations/).
